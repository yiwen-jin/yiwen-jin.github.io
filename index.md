## Short Bio

Hello, and welcome to my website! I earned my Ph.D. in Management Science at the [Operations and Logistics Division](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/operations-and-logistics), UBC Sauder School of Business. I was fortunate to be advised by [Yichuan Ding](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/yichuan-daniel-ding), [Mahesh Nagarajan](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/mahesh-nagarajan), [Steven Shechter](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/steven-shechter). 

**Update: I have joined the [Haskayne School of Business](https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/) at the University of Calgary as an assistant professor since July 2024.**

Research interests: healthcare analytics, behavioral queueing, supply chain management. I am passionate about using data-driven methods to enhance healthcare delivery processes and am dedicated to advancing understanding at the intersection of AI and healthcare. My research has been acknowledged with the [2023 POMS College of Healthcare Operations Management Best Paper Award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xin-david-ding-5b5b618_conference-education-poms-activity-7067906007045156864-xIVs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I am also interested in company diversity, sustainability, supply chain management and open to other fields in public sector and businesses.
