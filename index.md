## Short Bio

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Operations & Supply Chain Management at the [Haskayne School of Business](https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/), University of Calgary.  I received Ph.D. in Management Science at the [Operations and Logistics Division](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/operations-and-logistics), UBC Sauder School of Business, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Yichuan Ding](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/yichuan-daniel-ding), [Mahesh Nagarajan](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/mahesh-nagarajan), [Steven Shechter](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/steven-shechter). 

My research focuses on healthcare analytics, behavioral queueing, supply chain management, and empirical methods. Broadly, I am passionate about leveraging data generated from healthcare operations to uncover patterns and improve service delivery. I also work at the intersection of AI and healthcare to understand how emerging technologies reshape human beings' behaviour. My work has appeared in top-tier journals such as Manufacturing & Service Operations Management and has been recognized with the 2023 POMS College of Healthcare Operations Management Best Paper Award. I am also broadly interested in adjacent areas across business and data-driven decision-making.
