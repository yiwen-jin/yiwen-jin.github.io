## Short Bio

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Operations & Supply Chain Management at the [Haskayne School of Business](https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/), University of Calgary.  I received Ph.D. in Management Science at the [Operations and Logistics Division](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/operations-and-logistics), UBC Sauder School of Business, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Yichuan Ding](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/yichuan-daniel-ding), [Mahesh Nagarajan](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/mahesh-nagarajan), [Steven Shechter](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/steven-shechter). 

My research focuses on healthcare operations, technology, and supply chain management, using primarily empirical and queueing-based methods. My work has appeared in leading journals such as Manufacturing & Service Operations Management and has been recognized with the 2023 POMS College of Healthcare Operations Management Best Paper Award. Broadly, I also work on large-scale societal data to inform public policy and organizational decision-making, with a growing emphasis on how AI reshapes human behavior. I am also interested in adjacent areas across business, economics, and social sciences.
